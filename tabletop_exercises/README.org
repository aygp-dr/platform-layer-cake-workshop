* Introduction

This repository contains a series of **Tabletop Exercises (TTX)** designed to test our team's understanding of Layered Architecture and Disaster Recovery processes.

**Objective:** Identify gaps in our recovery playbooks and architectural dependencies without causing real downtime.

* Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Facilitator** | Runs the session, introduces "Injects" (new information/failures), keeps time. |
| **Incident Commander** | Leads the response team, makes final decisions. |
| **Scribe** | Records the timeline, decisions made, and questions asked. |
| **Service Owners** | Role-play as the owners of specific systems (DB, API, etc.). |

* How to Run a Session

1.  **Schedule**: Book 90 minutes. (60m exercise, 30m retro).
2.  **Select Scenario**: Choose one of the scenarios in this directory.
3.  **Briefing**: Review the "Steady State" and "Trigger Event".
4.  **Execution**:
    - Facilitator reveals "Injects" every 10-15 minutes.
    - Team discusses response actions.
    - *Constraint*: You cannot use tools that are marked as "DOWN".
5.  **Debrief**: Complete the Post-Mortem section.

* Available Scenarios

1.  [[file:01_circular_dependency_deadlock.org][Scenario 01: The Ouroboros Deadlock]] - Core circular dependency failure.
2.  [[file:02_deployment_darkness.org][Scenario 02: Deployment Darkness]] - Recovering when CI/CD is gone.
3.  [[file:03_split_brain_data.org][Scenario 03: Split-Brain Data]] - Data layer inconsistencies and recovery.

* Scoring Rubric

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Chaos** | Team panicked, no clear leader, circular blame. |
| **Reactive** | Solved the issue, but relied on "heroics" or undocumented hacks. |
| **Defined** | Followed a playbook, but found gaps or stale info. |
| **Resilient** | clear command, playbook worked, layers respected. |
